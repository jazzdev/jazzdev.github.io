= Fact vs Fear

Why aren't I going out?
What's the risk of
  a. Getting a mild Covid case (a few days home in bed)
  b. Getting a severe Covid case (need to be hospitalized)
  c. Getting a fatal Covid case
  
How do I mitigate the risk?

What are the trade-offs of the mitigation? Is the trade-off worth it?

Wish I could go back in time and choose to have two (separate) weeks of being home sick in bed instead of the choice I did make of:
  - No Travel
  - No Socializing
  - No Going Out to Hear Music
  
I think I made the wrong trade-off. I gave up a lot the last two years.  I would have rather had the two weeks of being sick.

== Social Responsibility

I want to be a good citizen and
  - Not spread Covid to any one else
  - Not add to overwhelming hospitals

One-way masking. People should mask to protect themselves.

He wants his grandkids in school, but not if there's a huge snow storm. Better to stay home for a week until the storm passes.
